## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

This challenge was really fun and not that hard at all !
My architecture is not clean though, also my implementation of dark mode is quite dirty. In fact I was planning to use SASS maps and @each to implement different themes, but that was quite too complex and time consuming for me.
It was my first time using Sass, and I could definitly have done better in organizing this mess.
(especially for Media Queries)
Concerning the work flow, I started by building the desktop design, with the API data in mind for later implementation.
I then coded the light/dark toggle.
Now it was time for that API, so I link my searchView to my model to fetch a query to the API, and store that user data in my model.state .
Then i just had to throw errors and render the new markup, and voil√† !

(I added the two media queries quickly with SASS and an external mixin named "include-media)

### Built with
